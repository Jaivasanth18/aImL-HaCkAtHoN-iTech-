## Negotiation Strategy  

### 1. Opening Offer – Anchoring  
- The agent always begins at **65% of market price** to set a strong psychological anchor.  
- Message frames the price as *respectful* and *inevitable*, not cheap.  
- Ensures it stays within budget.  

### 2. Concession Pattern  
- Concessions follow a structured escalation:  
  - **Rounds 1–3**: Small concessions (≈5% of seller’s price).  
  - **Rounds 4–6**: Moderate concessions (≈10%).  
  - **Rounds 7–10**: Larger concessions (≈15–20%) with time pressure applied.  
- Always ensures:  
  - Never exceeds buyer’s budget.  
  - Never offers more than seller’s last stated price.  

### 3. BATNA Evaluation (Best Alternative)  
- If seller drops below **90% of market price** (and within budget), the agent **immediately accepts**.  
- Prevents losing good deals by over-negotiating.  

### 4. Message Framing & Mirroring  
- Extracts **key terms** from seller’s language (e.g., “quality,” “fair,” “partnership”) and reflects them back.  
- Frames counter-offers as *balanced outcomes* that honor both market value and relationship.  
- Example: *“I understand your focus on quality. ₹X is a figure that respects both value and partnership.”*  

### 5. Time Pressure  
- In rounds **8–10**, emphasizes urgency:  
  - Phrases like *“Let us not lose time over what already feels inevitable.”*  
  - Pushes seller toward closure without appearing desperate.
